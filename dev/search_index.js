Larger values capture more global structure in the data, while small values capture more local structure.\nmetric::{SemiMetric, Symbol} = Euclidean(): the metric to calculate distance in the input space.

Determines how clustered embedded points are in combination with min_dist.\nset_operation_ratio::Real = 1: interpolates between fuzzy set union and fuzzy set intersection when constructing the UMAP graph (global fuzzy simplicial set). The value of this parameter should be between 1.0 and 0.0: 1.0 indicates pure fuzzy union, while 0.0 indicates pure fuzzy intersection.\nlocal_connectivity::Integer = 1: the number of nearest neighbors that should be assumed to be locally connected. The higher this value, the more connected the manifold becomes. This should not be set higher than the intrinsic dimension of the manifold.\nrepulsion_strength::Real = 1: the weighting of negative samples during the optimization process.\nneg_sample_rate::Integer = 5: the number of negative samples to select for each positive sample. Higher values will increase computational cost but result in slightly more accuracy.\na = nothing: this controls the embedding.
